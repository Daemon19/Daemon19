# Hi there 👋

## What I'm working on?
I'm currenly a high school student, so getting my ✨[favorite college](https://itb.ac.id/)✨ is my 1st priority. Other than that, I just tinker wit things I got interested (like Java).

## What I'm currently learning?
**Java** period. Why u ask? cause i'm registered to a contest of wits and afraid that java's question will show up 😐
